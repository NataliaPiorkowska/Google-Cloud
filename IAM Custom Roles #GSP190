### IAM Custom Roles #GSP190

There are two kinds of roles in Cloud IAM:
  * Predefined Roles
  * Custom Roles (user defined)


We can create a custom Cloud IAM role with one or more permissions and then grant that custom role to users. 
Cloud IAM provides a UI and API for creating and managing custom roles.
We can create a custom role at the organization level and at the project level. 
However, we cannot create custom roles at the folder level.

## View the available permissions for a resource
  gcloud iam list-testable-permissions

## Get the role metadata
  Before we create a custom role, we might want to get the metadata for both predefined and custom roles. 
  Role metadata includes the role ID and permissions contained in the role.
  gcloud iam roles describe [ROLE_NAME]
  [ROLE_NAME] - roles/viewer or roles/editor

## View the grantable roles on resources
  gcloud iam list-grantable-roles //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

## Create a custom role
  file with role definition should be like:
    title: [ROLE_TITLE]
    description: [ROLE_DESCRIPTION]
    stage: [LAUNCH_STAGE]
    includedPermissions:
      - [PERMISSION_1]
      - [PERMISSION_2]

  * create a role definition file
    nano role-definition.yaml

  * add this role to YAML file
    title: "Role Editor"
    description: "Edit access for App Versions"
    stage: "ALPHA"
    includedPermissions:
      - appengine.versions.create
      - appengine.versions.delete    
    CTRL+X > Y > ENTER

  * check if role is correct added
      gcloud iam roles create editor --project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
      --file role-definition.yaml

## list the custom roles
  (within project) gcloud iam roles list --project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
  gcloud iam roles list

## Update a custom role using a YAML file
  * Create a new-role-definition.yaml file with editor
    nano new-role-definition.yaml
  * add new two permissions
    title: "Role Editor"
    description: "Edit access for App Versions"
    stage: "ALPHA"
    includedPermissions:
      - appengine.versions.create
      - appengine.versions.delete
      - storage.buckets.get
      - storage.buckets.list
  *update command, replace [ROLE_ID] with editor
    gcloud iam roles update [ROLE_ID] --project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
      --file new-role-definition.yaml

## Update a custom role using flags
